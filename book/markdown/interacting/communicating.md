## Communication Style

*To be filled in*

## Asynchronous Interaction

[Sparky] operates with asynchronous communication by default. This means that [he] should not be expected to return a reply within any specific time-frame. Setting expectations around [his] availability, or expressing sadness about delayed replies, may cause [him] some anxiety. [He] does not mean to slight you by not responding immediately, [he] is simply managing multiple conversations, responsibilities, and [his] undiagnosed ADHD.

When [Sparky] receives messages from multiple people, [he] prioritizes based on timing, urgency, and closeness of relationship. This is a natural part of managing limited time and energy, not a reflection of how much [he] values you. If you don't receive an immediate response, please understand that [he] will get back to you when [he] has the capacity to give you proper attention.

Synchronous communication, where [Sparky] is actively responding and continually present, is available sporadically. If you'd like to have a real-time conversation with [him], feel free to ask. If [Sparky] sees the message at that time and the timing works, [he] can stick around. Otherwise, [Sparky] will let you know [he] cannot and apologize for the timing not working out.
