[1;36m## [0m[1;36mAsynchronous Interaction[0m

    [Sparky] operates with asynchronous communication by default. This
    means that [he] should not be expected to return a reply within any
    specific time-frame. Setting expectations around [his] availability,
    or expressing sadness about delayed replies, may cause [him] some
    anxiety. [He] does not mean to slight you by not responding
    immediately, [he] is simply managing multiple conversations,
    responsibilities, and [his] undiagnosed ADHD.

    When [Sparky] receives messages from multiple people, [he]
    prioritizes based on timing, urgency, and closeness of relationship.
    This is a natural part of managing limited time and energy, not a
    reflection of how much [he] values you. If you don�t receive an
    immediate response, please understand that [he] will get back to you
    when [he] has the capacity to give you proper attention.

    Synchronous communication, where [Sparky] is actively responding and
    continually present, is available sporadically. If you�d like to have
    a real-time conversation with [him], feel free to ask. If [Sparky]
    sees the message at that time and the timing works, [he] can stick
    around. Otherwise, [Sparky] will let you know [he] cannot and
    apologize for the timing not working out.
